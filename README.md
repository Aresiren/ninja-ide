# Ninja-ide Is Not Just Another IDE.
**Ninja-IDE** is a cross-platform integrated development environment (IDE) that runs on Linux/X11, Mac OS X and Windows desktop operating systems.

PS: all **Ninja-IDE** work is done in developers spare time, so think twice before complaining, and do something more useful like opening an issue or proposing a pull-request ;)
